*This section outlines my professional development goals and planned learning activities in Technology Enhanced Learning.*

## Immediate Priorities

My immediate priority is managing the business simulation software transition, ensuring seamless implementation of the new provider selected through our systematic review process. This involves developing comprehensive training materials for academic staff, creating student guides that highlight new features, and establishing feedback mechanisms to monitor the transition's effectiveness. Working closely with the Faculty Learning Technologies Manager and Programme Leads who use simulations extensively, I will coordinate migration timelines, data transfer processes, and pilot implementations to minimise disruption whilst maximising the pedagogical benefits of enhanced AI-supported feedback capabilities.

Continuing the momentum of VLE improvement remains essential. The Moodle Masterpieces campaign will evolve based on participant feedback and emerging best practices. I plan to develop a repository of exemplary designs that colleagues can adapt, creating a sustainable culture of quality VLE design. Regular accessibility audits using Blackboard Ally will track our collective progress, with targeted support for modules still facing challenges. This sustained focus on VLE quality directly impacts thousands of students while building staff confidence in digital design.

## Scaling Innovation

The university's interest in adopting the AI Innovation Challenge model across other faculties presents an exciting opportunity for scaling impact. I plan to develop a comprehensive implementation toolkit including facilitator training programmes, customisable challenge scenarios for different disciplines, and assessment frameworks that maintain rigour whilst allowing disciplinary flexibility. This institutional expansion requires careful attention to quality assurance while maintaining the pedagogical integrity that makes the Innovation Challenge effective.

The Devonport building implementation offers opportunities to shape how immersive technologies integrate with business education. I will develop pedagogical frameworks for using the 360-degree immersive space effectively, creating sample lesson plans and assessment strategies that leverage spatial computing. This includes training materials for staff who may feel intimidated by advanced technology, ensuring broad adoption rather than specialist use. Documentation of our implementation journey will provide valuable insights for other institutions planning similar facilities.

## Professional Development and Sector Engagement

My medium-term plans involve contributing to national conversations about responsible AI integration in higher education. Through publications in peer-reviewed journals and presentations at conferences like the ALT Conference and Advance HE events, I will share evidence-based insights from our initiatives. By engaging with professional bodies and contributing to policy discussions, I can help shape sector-wide approaches to AI in education.

I aim to progress to full CMALT accreditation, using the reflective insights gained from this Associate portfolio to identify areas for deeper engagement. This progression aims to reflect not just personal development but commitment to advancing professional standards in learning technology.

## Commitment to Inclusive Practice

Throughout these plans, accessibility and inclusion remain fundamental principles guiding all initiatives. Every new technology or pedagogical innovation must enhance equitable access to education. This commitment extends beyond compliance to actively seeking ways technology can remove barriers and create opportunities for all learners.
