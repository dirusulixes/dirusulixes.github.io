As Faculty Technology-Enhanced Learning Tutor at Greenwich Business School (GBS), University of Greenwich, I lead strategic initiatives that enhance teaching and learning through evidence-based technological innovation. My interdisciplinary background as Associate Professor in Organisational Sociology shapes how I approach TEL challenges—examining how emerging technologies reshape collaborative practices and organisational dynamics in educational settings. My role encompasses membership of the Faculty Student Success Committee and, until its reorganisation in 2025, the University Learning Technologies Committee. This dual positioning has enabled me to influence institutional TEL strategy whilst maintaining direct engagement with pedagogical practice.

## Professional Journey

My journey in learning technology began through addressing software limitations in teaching quantitative methods. When founding the [NUSC Summer School](https://networks-and-urban-systems-centre-nusc.github.io/summer-school/) in 2012—the [Networks and Urban Systems Centre's](https://www.gre.ac.uk/research/nusc) intensive programme in network and data science that continues to run annually—I initially focused on statistical packages like R and SPSS. However, participant feedback revealed that pre-loaded datasets and copy-paste coding exercises failed to engage. I transformed the technical setup to enable real-time data import, cloud-based collaborative coding environments, and interactive visualisation tools. 

This evolution continued around 2016-17 when I introduced tablets running Network Canvas software for the BA International Business programme, enabling students to collect and visualise network data dynamically in classrooms. By integrating mobile technologies with traditional statistical software, I moved from static computer lab sessions to flexible, interactive learning environments. The progression from basic software training to integrated technology ecosystems established patterns I continue to develop through current AI and immersive technology initiatives.

## Current Role and Leadership

Taking on the Faculty Technology-Enhanced Learning Tutor role in 2023, which constitutes 50% of my allocated time, positioned me at the intersection of academic practice and technological innovation. This substantial commitment enables me to maintain my research and teaching whilst dedicating significant focus to TEL leadership. One of my first initiatives was securing funding for Greenwich to participate in [AdvanceHE's "Preparing for an AI-Enabled Future" programme](https://www.advance-he.ac.uk/consultancy-and-enhancement/change-impact-programmes/preparing-for-ai-enabled-future). This involved assembling a cross-functional team that exemplified my bridge-building approach—bringing together the University TEL Lead and Senior TEL Tutor with faculty Associate Heads of Student Success and Programme Leaders to develop curriculum transformation strategies beginning with the BA in Entrepreneurship and Innovation.

Building on this momentum, in 2023 I established and now chair the GBS TEL Working Group (see [Core Areas 1a](/core-area-1a/) and [4a](/core-area-4a/))—the faculty's first formal structure bringing together academics and learning technologists. This collaborative approach has influenced significant decisions, from major procurement processes to conceptual design of technology-enhanced learning spaces for our new building development. The working group also advances good practice in VLE design and accessibility standards, creating formal channels where learning technologists' expertise shapes academic practice and institutional strategy.

## Strategic Initiatives and Impact

Current initiatives reflect both strategic planning and direct implementation. I co-developed and deliver a comprehensive GenAI programme (see [Core Areas 1b](/core-area-1b/) and [3a](/core-area-3a/)) reaching over 30 staff per workshop, exploring everything from privacy-focused local deployment to sophisticated applications in statistical analysis. Simultaneously, I maintain direct student engagement through projects like the [NUSC Summer School website challenge](https://networks-and-urban-systems-centre-nusc.github.io/summer-school/) (see [Core Area 1b](/core-area-1b/)), where I mentored the winning student through GitHub deployment, demonstrating that strategic leadership need not mean disconnection from hands-on practice. The AI-Enhanced Business Innovation Challenge (see [Core Area 2a](/core-area-2a/)) represents another key initiative, transforming how students engage with AI as collaborative learning partners rather than mere tools.

My approach prioritises inclusive design and evidence-based implementation. The VLE accessibility campaign (see [Core Areas 1b](/core-area-1b/) and [3a](/core-area-3a/)) exemplifies this—systematically identifying barriers and implementing targeted interventions that measurably improved staff confidence in creating accessible content. Similarly, the student laptop loan scheme (see [Core Area 4a](/core-area-4a/)) addresses digital poverty through sustainable support structures. These initiatives, alongside the comprehensive business simulation evaluation (see [Core Area 1a](/core-area-1a/)) and strategic planning for immersive learning spaces in our new building (see [Core Area 4a](/core-area-4a/)), demonstrate consistent commitment to removing barriers through thoughtful technology deployment.

## CMALT Journey and Future Vision

I am pursuing Associate CMALT to connect with fellow learning technology professionals who navigate similar technical challenges. This accreditation validates competencies developed through diverse technical implementations—from statistical software deployment to GitHub-based student projects, from VLE accessibility automation to immersive technology specification. The reflective process helps articulate the technical progression from solving individual software problems to architecting institutional technology ecosystems. 

As our university implements new infrastructure including 360-degree projection systems and develops AI-integrated curricula, [CMALT](https://www.alt.ac.uk/certified-membership) membership provides access to collective technical expertise whilst contributing my own insights to the wider community of practice. The [Association for Learning Technology](https://www.alt.ac.uk/) represents the professional home for those of us committed to evidence-based innovation in educational technology, and I look forward to contributing to this community's ongoing development.

## Professional Context

My work spans institutional boundaries, from leading faculty initiatives to contributing to national conversations about responsible AI integration in higher education. You can learn more about my academic background and research interests on my [university profile](https://www.gre.ac.uk/people/rep/faculty-of-business/guido-conaldi). The intersection of technology, learning, and organisational change continues to drive my professional practice, ensuring that innovation serves pedagogical purpose rather than technological possibility.

This contextual foundation supports the evidence and reflection presented across the core areas of this portfolio, demonstrating how strategic TEL leadership emerges from understanding both technical capabilities and educational needs.
