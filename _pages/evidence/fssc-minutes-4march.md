## Business Simulation Software Review

[Colleague A] presented a comprehensive analysis of business simulation software providers. The group reviewed current usage patterns, noting that BOSS is currently the largest user of Edumundo simulations within the faculty. [Colleague A] highlighted that current costs exceed £100K annually, with licences priced at approximately £36 per simulation per student. 

The group discussed several alternative providers:

**Cesim:** Offering approximately £30 per licence with a potential €50,000 cap on total costs (roughly half the current expenditure)

**Harvard Business Publishing:** Offering 128 simulations but requiring individual educator verification

**Hubro:** A smaller company with 7 simulations and similar pricing to Edumundo

**Eureka:** Initial contact made but awaiting further information

The group noted that Cesim has been the most responsive provider and offers AI-supported feedback within their simulations, though they lack experience integrating with Moodle. Members discussed the importance of balancing cost savings with pedagogical considerations, particularly ensuring that alternative providers' simulations align with current module learning outcomes. 

The group agreed to focus immediate attention on Edumundo, Cesim, and potentially Eureka and Hubro pending further information. Members discussed the need to involve module leaders in the evaluation process while being mindful of raised expectations.

### Actions:

- [Colleague A] to update login credentials for Cesim demonstration
- [Colleague A] to follow up with Eureka regarding demonstration access
- Working group members to review shortlisted providers within one week
- Guido Conaldi to update [Senior Leader] regarding potential next steps, including module leader consultations
- [Colleague B] to review Hubro when access is provided
