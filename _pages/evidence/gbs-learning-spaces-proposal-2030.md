This proposal outlines the essential requirements for creating future-ready learning spaces that will equip students with relevant skills for the evolving workplace. Our vision encompasses a strategic mix of learning environments that can support diverse pedagogical approaches while maintaining adaptability for future technological developments.

We propose a tiered approach to learning spaces:

- Standard teaching rooms with basic but upgradeable technological infrastructure
- Fully-equipped TEAL rooms supporting comprehensive technology integration  
- Specialised spaces including a Data Visualisation Suite, Bloomberg Suite, and immersive VR facilities

Within this framework, we identify two key areas for immediate development:

## 1. Future-Proofing TEAL Rooms for 2030

To ensure that TEAL rooms remain effective through 2030, it's critical to design them for **blended, flexible group work**, supporting both in-person and remote students seamlessly. Hybrid learning environments that integrate digital and physical spaces can significantly enhance engagement and inclusivity (Raes et al., 2020). TEAL rooms should be equipped to work with students' personal devices, such as smartphones and laptops, allowing students to participate actively whether they are on campus or joining remotely. The AV should also be set up to allow each team to communicate with team members joining remotely. By integrating personal devices with room technology, we can foster more accessible and adaptable group learning.

Furthermore, TEAL rooms should support **VR, AR, and XR capabilities** to enhance experiential learning. By equipping TEAL rooms with VR headsets and mobile-compatible XR tools, students can participate in **business simulations** and interactive case studies that develop key skills in decision-making, problem-solving, and team collaboration. Research supports the use of immersive simulations in business education, where hands-on, realistic experiences enhance learning and engagement (Bower et al., 2020). Traditional TEAL configurations, with pods and screens for group discussions, will require updating to accommodate these immersive tools, ensuring the rooms remain flexible and adaptable for future technological advances.

### Proposed use cases for these future-ready TEAL spaces include:

- **Interactive Business Simulations and Case Studies**: Students can engage in realistic business scenarios through mixed reality, enhancing skills in problem-solving and decision-making.
- **Group Collaboration with Device Integration**: Allowing students to use their own devices within collaborative pods will enable flexible teamwork for both local and remote students.
- **Virtual International Learning Partnerships (COILs)**: XR technology will support global collaborations, allowing students to participate in international projects and develop cross-cultural competencies.

By planning for these technological capabilities, Greenwich Business School can create TEAL spaces that align with the demands of a digitally advanced workforce, fostering an engaged and active learning environment (Raes et al., 2020).

## 2. Establishing a Data Visualisation Suite

A dedicated **Data Visualisation Suite** is essential to prepare students for data-centric roles increasingly common in business. Visualization tools and projection technologies allow students to interact dynamically with data, developing analytical and critical-thinking skills essential for interpreting complex information. This suite would enable students to engage with real-time data, supporting individual and collaborative analysis.

Incorporating **projection mapping technology and high-resolution display systems** will allow students to visualise large datasets and complex analyses in a shared space, enhancing both comprehension and group discussion. A Data Visualisation Suite will support essential use cases, such as:

- **Data-Driven Business Simulations and Presentations**: Students can present and analyze data-driven projects, building public speaking skills while making complex data insights accessible.
- **Real-World Industry and Community Project Work**: Visualization tools will facilitate the analysis of live data from industry partners, offering practical experience in data interpretation relevant to various business roles.

Investing in this suite will position Greenwich Business School at the forefront of data-driven education, equipping students with essential skills for a data-centric business environment.

## Benchmarking and Exemplary Cases

Leading universities have already integrated immersive and data visualization technologies into their business programs:

- **Imperial College Business School's IDEA Lab**: The Lab uses AI-driven simulations and VR-based experiential modules within MBA and executive education programs, including VR simulations for leadership training and crisis management.

## Workshop Preparation Document

### Session 1: Pedagogic Principles

**Current to Future Teaching Split Analysis**

The traditional balance between directed (didactic) and guided (project-based) learning is already shifting at GBS. The didactic component is on average lower than 75% already at GBS and is moving towards a more balanced and dynamic learning approach. While specific percentages will vary by programme and depend on available technology, we envision a substantial reduction in didactic learning over the next five years, shifting towards more guided, project-based approaches.

This transformation aligns with our vision for future-ready TEAL spaces that will equip students with relevant skills for the evolving workplace. In our view, these spaces must support blended, flexible group work, integrating both physical and digital learning environments. The shift towards more guided learning will be facilitated by technological infrastructure that includes VR, AR, and XR capabilities for business simulations and interactive case studies.

**Flexible Learning Implementation**

To achieve this transformation, we propose implementing flexible teaching patterns that can be adapted to various pedagogical needs. A typical three-hour teaching block could follow several patterns. One effective model introduces specific themes through a 15-minute directed session, followed by a 10-minute individual learning task, a 10-minute group learning activity, and concludes with a 10-minute feedback or evaluation period before a short break. This pattern can then repeat with variations based on learning objectives.

An alternative pattern might begin with a 20-minute directed content session, followed by 20 minutes of collaborative learning, incorporating breaks and evaluation periods as needed. Crucially, these patterns would be supported by high-quality pre and post-learning activities in our VLE, creating a coherent learning journey that extends beyond the classroom.

### Session 2: Teaching Spaces

Looking towards 2030, we envision a strategic mix of learning spaces that accommodates various pedagogical needs and technological requirements. While all teaching spaces must maintain a baseline readiness to support technology-enhanced learning, we propose a tiered approach to space development:

1. **Standard teaching rooms** with basic but upgradeable technological infrastructure, designed to accommodate temporary technology deployment as needed. These spaces would support lower-complexity teaching scenarios while maintaining the flexibility to evolve.

2. **Fully-equipped TEAL rooms** that incorporate all the features detailed in our proposal, supporting blended and hybrid learning with comprehensive technological integration.

3. **Specialised spaces** including:
   - The Data Visualisation Suite
   - The Bloomberg Suite  
   - An immersive VR space for advanced simulation and experiential learning

This mixed approach ensures we can support diverse pedagogical needs while maintaining adaptability for future technological developments.

### Session 3: Student Interface

**Student Experience Vision**

The optimal student experience we envision typically involves students being on campus for two full days per week, experiencing a carefully designed mix of learning modalities. These days would combine structured directed learning sessions with collaborative project work and self-directed study opportunities. This approach aligns with our proposal for Virtual International Learning Partnerships (COILs), where XR technology supports global collaborations and helps students develop cross-cultural competencies.

**Implementation Requirements**

To realize this vision, we must consider several key requirements. Our teaching spaces need to support flexible teaching patterns and various group sizes, with easy reconfiguration options for different teaching modes. Technology integration should be seamless but not overwhelming, maintaining the ability to conduct tech-free sessions when pedagogically appropriate.

We propose incorporating learning analytics capabilities to understand and respond to student engagement in real-time, while maintaining appropriate privacy considerations. This aligns with exemplary cases from leading institutions such as Imperial College Business School's IDEA Lab and the University of Wales Trinity Saint David's immersive rooms, while being specifically tailored to Greenwich Business School's unique needs and student population.
