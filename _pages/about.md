This portfolio showcases my professional expertise and ongoing development in Technology Enhanced Learning as Faculty TEL Lead at Greenwich Business School, University of Greenwich. Through concrete examples from my practice, I demonstrate how educational technology can transform learning experiences whilst addressing the complex challenges facing modern higher education.

## Portfolio Structure

This portfolio addresses the five core areas required for Associate CMALT accreditation:

### Core Areas

**[Contextual Statement](/contextual-statement/)** - Professional background and CMALT journey

**[Core Area 1a: Understanding Technology Constraints and Benefits](/core-area-1a/)** - Demonstrating understanding of how different technologies support learning within institutional constraints

**[Core Area 1b: Technical Knowledge and Ability](/core-area-1b/)** - Evidence of technical competence in learning technology implementation and support

**[Core Area 2a: Teaching, Learning and Assessment Processes](/core-area-2a/)** - Understanding pedagogical applications of educational technology

Each section includes **Description**, **Reflection**, and supporting **Evidence** as required by the CMALT framework.

**AI Use Note:** During portfolio development, I used  GenAI models including Claude Sonnet 4, Llama 3.3, and DeepSeek-R1 for language support with grammar, syntax, and clarity of expression. As a non-native English speaker, this assistance helped ensure clear communication whilst all ideas, reflections, and professional examples remain entirely my own work and authentic representation of my practice in learning technology.
